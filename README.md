## Prompt Engineering

`prompt-engineering.md` is extracted from [Southbridge Research's exceptional analysis of Claude Code prompts](https://southbridge-research.notion.site/Prompt-Engineering-The-Art-of-Instructing-AI-2055fec70db181369002dcdea7d9e732). This document has been invaluable for understanding and applying advanced prompt engineering techniques.

When optimizing prompts with these techniques:
```
Apply ALL prompt engineering patterns from `prompt-engineering.md` to this modification. For EACH change you make, you MUST specify EXACTLY which technique(s) you used by providing:

1. **Pattern name** (e.g., "Progressive Disclosure", "Emphasis Hierarchy")
2. **Rationale** - Why this specific pattern applies to this particular change
3. **Expected outcome** - What behavioral impact you anticipate from applying this pattern

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Any changes made without complete pattern attribution will result in an incomplete task. Every modification must be justified with the above three-part explanation.
